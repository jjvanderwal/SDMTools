\usage{
ClassStat(mat, cellsize = 1, bkgd = NA, latlon = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mat}{a matrix of data with patches identified as
  classes (unique integer values) as e.g., a binary
  landscape of a species distribution or a vegetation map.
  Matrix can be a raster of class 'asc' (adehabitat
  package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
  'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package)}

  \item{cellsize}{cell size (in meters) is a single value
  representing the width/height of cell edges (assuming
  square cells)}

  \item{bkgd}{the background value for which statistics
  will not be calculated}

  \item{latlon}{boolean value representing if the data is
  geographic. If latlon == TRUE, matrix must be of class
  'asc', 'RasterLayer' or 'SpatialGridDataFrame'}
}
\value{
a data.frame listing \item{class}{a particular patch type
from the original input matrix (\code{mat}).}
\item{n.patches}{the number of patches of a particular
patch type or in a class.} \item{total.area}{the sum of the
areas (m2) of all patches of the corresponding patch type.}
\item{prop.landscape}{the proportion of the total landscape
represented by this class} \item{patch.density}{the numbers
of patches of the corresponding patch type divided by total
landscape area (m2).} \item{total.edge}{the total edge
length of a particular patch type.}
\item{edge.density}{edge length on a per unit area basis
that facilitates comparison among landscapes of varying
size.} \item{landscape.shape.index}{a standardized measure
of total edge or edge density that adjusts for the size of
the landscape.} \item{largest.patch.index}{largest patch
index quantifies the percentage of total landscape area
comprised by the largest patch.}
\item{mean.patch.area}{average area of patches.}
\item{sd.patch.area}{standard deviation of patch areas.}
\item{min.patch.area}{the minimum patch area of the total
patch areas. } \item{max.patch.area}{the maximum patch area
of the total patch areas.}
\item{perimeter.area.frac.dim}{perimeter-area fractal
dimension equals 2 divided by the slope of regression line
obtained by regressing the logarithm of patch area (m2)
against the logarithm of patch perimeter (m).}
\item{mean.perim.area.ratio}{the mean of the ratio patch
perimeter. The perimeter-area ratio is equal to the ratio
of the patch perimeter (m) to area (m2).}
\item{sd.perim.area.ratio}{standard deviation of the ratio
patch perimeter.} \item{min.perim.area.ratio}{minimum
perimeter area ratio} \item{max.perim.area.ratio}{maximum
perimeter area ratio.} \item{mean.shape.index}{mean of
shape index} \item{sd.shape.index}{standard deviation of
shape index.} \item{min.shape.index}{the minimum shape
index.} \item{max.shape.index}{the maximum shape index.}
\item{mean.frac.dim.index}{mean of fractal dimension
index.} \item{sd.frac.dim.index}{standard deviation of
fractal dimension index.} \item{min.frac.dim.index}{the
minimum fractal dimension index.}
\item{max.frac.dim.index}{the maximum fractal dimension
index.} \item{total.core.area}{the sum of the core areas of
the patches (m2).} \item{prop.landscape.core}{proportional
landscape core} \item{mean.patch.core.area}{mean patch core
area.} \item{sd.patch.core.area}{standard deviation of
patch core area.} \item{min.patch.core.area}{the minimum
patch core area.} \item{max.patch.core.area}{the maximum
patch core area.} \item{prop.like.adjacencies}{calculated
from the adjacency matrix, which shows the frequency with
which different pairs of patch types (including like
adjacencies between the same patch type) appear
side-by-side on the map (measures the degree of aggregation
of patch types).} \item{aggregation.index}{computed simply
as an area-weighted mean class aggregation index, where
each class is weighted by its proportional area in the
landscape.} \item{landscape.division.index}{based on the
cumulative patch area distribution and is interpreted as
the probability that two randomly chosen pixels in the
landscape are not situated in the same patch}
\item{splitting.index}{based on the cumulative patch area
distribution and is interpreted as the effective mesh
number, or number of patches with a constant patch size
when the landscape is subdivided into S patches, where S is
the value of the splitting index.}
\item{effective.mesh.size}{equals 1 divided by the total
landscape area (m2) multiplied by the sum of patch area
(m2) squared, summed across all patches in the landscape.}
\item{patch.cohesion.index}{measures the physical
connectedness of the corresponding patch type.}

\description{
\code{ClassStat} calculates the class statistics for patch
types identified in a matrix of data or in a raster of
class 'asc' (SDMTools & adehabitat packages), 'RasterLayer'
(raster package) or 'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package).
}
\details{
The class statistics are based on statistics calculated by
fragstats
