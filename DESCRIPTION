Description: This packages provides a set of tools for post processing the
    outcomes of species distribution modeling exercises. It includes novel
    methods for comparing models and tracking changes in distributions through
    time. It further includes methods for visualizing outcomes, selecting
    thresholds, calculating measures of accuracy and landscape fragmentation
    statistics, etc.. This package was made possible in part by financial
    support from the Australian Research Council & ARC Research Network for
